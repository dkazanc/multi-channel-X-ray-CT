** INSTALLATION of dependencies **
Here we provide detailed installation information for the following dependencies: 

 ## ASTRA-toolbox 
---------- can be downloaded at https://www.astra-toolbox.com/downloads/index.html and installed according to the documentation. In Matlab provide path to the package. 

## Software dependencies for data generation script (NOTE that the pre-generated data are also provided so one can proceed directly to the reconstruction stage if needed): 
 * [Photon Attenuation](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12092-photonattenuation) 
 ---------- No installation is required, just uncompress the content into "SupplementaryPackages/PhotonAttenuation/"
 NOTE: please see the issue https://github.com/dkazanc/multi-channel-X-ray-CT/issues/1 to correct a bug in Software
 * [Spektr](http://istar.jhu.edu/downloads/) 
 ---------- No installation is required, just uncompress the content into "SupplementaryPackages/spektr/"

## Software dependencies for data reconstruction script: 
 * [CCPi-Regularisation Toolkit](https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Regularisation-Toolkit)
---------- uncompress the content into "SupplementaryPackages/CCPi-RegularisationToolkit/". 
1. Start matlab and proceed to the folder "CCPi-RegularisationToolkit/Wrappers/Matlab/mex_compile/"
2. run compileCPU_mex.m to compile CPU functions
3. open compileGPU_mex.m and edit according to your system specifications
4. run compileGPU_mex.m to compile GPU functions
Note that one can use only CPU modules if GPU modules can't be installed. See more in the script "SpectralReconDemo.m"
 * [Spot operator package](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spot/) 
 ---------- No installation is required, just uncompress the content into "SupplementaryPackages/spot/"
